# filex
C# ML.NET Command Line Tool for performing Static File Analysis on files.  The idea behind this tool is akin to using the file command - a simple, but effective tool to determine what file type a file is using a combination of file magic and additional file header parsing.  filex takes it a step further by providing a machine learning classification on some file types.
